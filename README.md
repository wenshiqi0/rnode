# What is this

Node.js on pure Rust (still working on it).

# Why do this

Just want to do some Node.js things and Rust things.

# How to do this

Just like Deno, first may use rusty_v8 to run Javascript and I just do some bindings.

After all, I should make a Javascript core by pure Rust on my own and may support Typescript.

# Who am I

Font-end developer who love Rust and C.
